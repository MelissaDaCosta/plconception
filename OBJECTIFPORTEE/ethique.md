# Ethique

## Alfred Adler 

- First, Adler admonished that education should not be “specialized” to the individual to the extent that it threatens the development of social interest. 
- Second, educators should use restraint when using IQ tests. Such tests should be used merely to gauge the student’s vulnerable areas and initiate remediation. IQ should never be used as a means for educators to place limits on the student’s learning potential and avoid taking responsibility for the student’s progress. 
- Third, students should not be subject to overcrowded classrooms due to the potential for neglect and disempowerment.
- Fourth, educators should make every attempt to avoid having students repeat grades due to its demoralizing potential. 
- Fifth, educators should similarly attempt to avoid setting up classrooms for slow students for the same reason. 
- Sixth and finally, educators should become aware of the many ways that coming from a lower socioeconomic home might interfere with the process of becoming a mature student.
