# Key factors for Sustainability


• Empower project leadership to set and achieve goals
– Select leaders and key staff with requisite experience; clearly communicate mission and goals of the organisation; and create an atmosphere that encourages an entrepreneurial spirit, including a willingness to test new ideas.
• Craft a strong value proposition
– Create a resource that offers unique value and continue to add value to the resource based on an understanding of users’ needs.
• Find creative ways to lower the direct costs of running the project.
– Secure contributions from the host institution; outsource work through vendors and other external partnerships; work with volunteers.
• Cultivate sources of revenue to cover both direct costs and ongoing
upgrades.
– Experiment with different revenue models to find the ones that are the best fit for the project; show willingness to try new models; cultivate the ability to identify and communicate the value of the resource to the target audience (of customers, authors, subscribers and so forth).
• Establish a system of accountability and measurement of the
success of the resource and the revenue model.
– Establish goals and targets and determine the balance between financial and mission-related returns; assess
progress towards mission-based and financial goals and targets.
